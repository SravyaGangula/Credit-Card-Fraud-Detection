# Credit Card Fraud Detection: Handling Imbalanced Data with a Machine Learning Approach.

As digital payment systems continue to grow, credit card fraud is escalating at an alarming rate, resulting in billions of dollars in global losses. This issue inflicts severe financial and reputational harm on both individuals and financial institutions.

Traditional fraud prevention methods are no longer sufficient to address this challenge, leading to the adoption of smarter, automated systems. This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset analyzed consists of transactions made by credit card users in Europe over two days in September 2013.

To address privacy concerns, the dataset underwent a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation, anonymizing most variables. However, the following variables remain in their original form:

Time: The time elapsed since the start of the transaction.
Amount: The transaction amount.
The target variable, Class, indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0).

## Overview

This document provides a detailed description of the Fraud Detection project implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The project aims to build a robust system for identifying fraudulent activities using data-driven methodologies. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation.This study aims to develop an efficient fraud detection model to mitigate losses and improve the security of digital payment systems.

## Objectives

Develop a machine learning model capable of accurately detecting fraudulent transactions.

Minimize false positives and false negatives to ensure the system's reliability.

Explore various classification models and select the most effective one for the task.

Visualize and interpret model results to ensure clarity and actionability.

## Dataset

The dataset contains transaction-level information with labeled data indicating fraudulent and non-fraudulent activities. Key attributes include transaction amount, time, and various anonymized features.

## Methodology

## 1. Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and remove irrelevant columns.

Normalization: Scale features to standardize their range, improving model performance.

Class Imbalance Handling: Address the skewed distribution of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent classes using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualization: Analyze the distribution of features and class labels using histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.

Insights: Identify patterns or anomalies that could enhance model performance.

## 3. Feature Engineering:

Feature Selection: Remove redundant or irrelevant features using statistical methods or domain knowledge.

Precision, Recall, and F1-score

ROC-AUC Score

## Tools: Use confusion matrices and ROC curves for a detailed evaluation.

## Questions we are aiming to solve:

1.Data Insights and Exploration

2.What percentage of transactions are fraudulent versus non-fraudulent?

3.Are there any notable patterns in fraudulent transactions based on the time or amount?

4.What are the key differences between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions in terms of feature distributions?

## Feature Analysis:

Which features contribute most significantly to distinguishing fraudulent transactions?

Is there a correlation between specific features and the likelihood of fraud?

## Model Performance:

Which machine learning model performed the best in detecting fraudulent transactions?

What are the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the chosen model?

How well does the model balance the trade-off between false positives and false negatives?

What is the AUC-ROC score for the best-performing model, and how does it compare to others?

## Data Preparation:

How is the class imbalance addressed in the dataset?

What preprocessing techniques are applied to normalize or transform the data?

Practical Applications

How can this model be deployed for real-world fraud detection?

What additional data or features could enhance the performance of the current model?

## Results:

The best-performing model achieved an F1-score of X (insert value) and an AUC-ROC score of Y (insert value).

The model effectively reduced false negatives, ensuring minimal overlooked fraudulent activities.

## How to Use:

Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

Run the notebook sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and generate results.

Use the provided functions for deploying the model on new datasets.

## Future Improvements:

Real-time Detection: Integrate the model into a pipeline for real-time fraud detection.

Advanced Feature Engineering: Experiment with deep learning-based feature extraction.

Explainability: Use SHAP or LIME to explain model decisions for end-user trust.

Ensemble Learning: Combine multiple models to further boost performance.

## Conclusion:

Based on our analysis, we concluded that the Random Forest model is the most suitable choice for this task. However, its performance in predicting fraudulent transactions is still not optimal.

A key factor influencing this outcome is the severe class imbalance in the dataset, where normal transactions significantly outnumber fraudulent ones. This imbalance likely hampers the model's ability to effectively identify fraud.

In summary, while the model demonstrates strong overall performance, it faces challenges in accurately detecting fraudulent transactions, highlighting the need for further refinements or alternative approaches to improve its effectiveness.
