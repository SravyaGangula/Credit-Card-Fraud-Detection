# Credit Card Fraud Detection: Handling Imbalanced Data with a Machine Learning Approach.

As digital payment systems continue to grow, credit card fraud is escalating at an alarming rate, resulting in billions of dollars in global losses. This issue inflicts severe financial and reputational harm on both individuals and financial institutions.

Traditional fraud prevention methods are no longer sufficient to address this challenge, leading to the adoption of smarter, automated systems. This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset analyzed consists of transactions made by credit card users in Europe over two days in September 2013.

To address privacy concerns, the dataset underwent a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation, anonymizing most variables. However, the following variables remain in their original form:

Time: The time elapsed since the start of the transaction.
Amount: The transaction amount.
The target variable, Class, indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0).

This study aims to develop an efficient fraud detection model to mitigate losses and improve the security of digital payment systems.
